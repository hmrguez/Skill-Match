# SkillMatch Business Plan

## Executive Summary

### Mission Statement

Our mission is to provide a centralized repository of learning and working portfolio for every job searcher or hiring
manager to find the perfect match for their needs.

### Problem Statement

As a software engineer, I've experienced a lot of trouble searching for jobs. For starters, no matter how much you learn
in platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, Udemy, etc, you pretty much have done nothing if you don't expose those skills,
and for that you need to be active in so many platforms in order for it to be worth something, pages like LinkedIn,
Indeed, etc. Secondly, no matter how much you learn, you can only show the hiring manager your resume, and pray that
they like it so much, that they will look deeper into your profile. Thirdly, if you are a hiring manager, you have to go
through so many resumes, and you have to go through so many platforms to find the perfect candidate for your job.
Fourthly, it's very hard to find an platform that is not only for job searching, but also for learning, and interacting
with other people.

### Solution

SkillMatch proposes to solve all this problems by creating a centralized repository where you can put all your learning
and working portfolio, as well as all your personal projects for other people to see, similar you what your GitHub
profile readme does, but with native support for customization and integration with job search and learning, with a
gamified factor of organizing you skills and fields of expertise using XP points and ranks. Similarly, for hiring
managers, they can find the perfect candidate for their job, by looking at their portfolio, and their personal projects,
and their learning portfolio, and their working portfolio, and their resume, all in one place, by using custom filters,
so they can find the perfect candidate instantly by just typing what skills they are looking for and the level of
proficiency they need. Also the purpose is not that this becomes a job platform, we want to make it a place where you
can learn, interact and compete with other people via coding problems, full-fledged knowledge exams and daily missions.

### Market Opportunity

Even after the massive layoffs at big tech companies, this is still a developers market. There are more jobs than
developers, and the demand is only going to increase. Every single business needs to be online if they want to survive
in this daily changing world, therefore, because of the fear of missing out, every medium to big company is looking for
developers, and they are willing to pay a lot of money for them. Also, the market for learning is huge, and it's only
going to get bigger, because of the same reason, every single business needs to be online, and they need to train their
employees to be able to do so. And also I feel that there is no platform that combines learning and job searching in a
way that entices both developers and recruiters to come daily, even if it's just to hang out, and that's a huge market
opportunity.

### Business Model

We plan to succeed with the freemium model. We plan to offer a lot of free functionalities and offer premium
functionalities just for a quality of life thing. That way we believe is the only way to achieve a massive user base
that will be essential in order to grow and expand in more functionalities, that will in turn have more premium
features, that will entice more the premium plan. The goal is to not deprive the user, whether you are a developer,
small or big company, you can all access to the same functionality; while having premium features that accelerate and
ease how you access stuff. An example of this model is the one carried by Valve, with Dota and their Dota Plus

| Indeed     | - Vast job listings and easy job search functionality     | - Limited focus on developer-specific skills     | High         | Due to their very large capabilities with regards of job searching, we plan to outmaneuver them using personalized filters for tech specific jobs, since most of the abilities required for those jobs tend to be shared among other job offers, therefore making the job searching and candidate searching experience more fluid                                                       |

| HackerRank | - Specialized coding challenges and technical assessments | - Limited job search and networking features     | Moderate     | HackerRank is our biggest competitor since they offer both job searching and learning alike for tech enthusiast but they lack the social component, where we stand by making profiles public and with built in customization to expose the skills you like as you like, plus the hiring capabilities are not free while ours are, so small to medium companies will prefer us over them |
