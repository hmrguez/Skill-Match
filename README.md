# Idea

It's called Skillmatch. I'm a Junior software engineer and I've suffered the problems of job search. I have a well built portfolio but sometimes I feel that you need to get out there in so many places in order for it to be worth something (ie. Leetcode, Linkedin, Indeed, HackerRank, Github, Udemy). My project is based on the idea that everyone with a strong portfolio of projects, courses and academic and job background is considered a a good candidate for a job position. That said my project starts as a gamified center for gathering all that portfolio, courses, academic and job info for a person, where people get XP points in the different programming languages and technologies they have worked on according to a certain criteria.  This doesn't just mean that the app will make web scraping for your info, just for the ones with open APIs, and the rest of the data should be submitted and then corroborated (using ML or manual). This is the first step of the project. With all that info, recruiters can post job offers applying filters according to the languages and technologies they need to query the database for people that meet the requirements, easing the job search and recruiting tasks since everything is centralized. Additionally people can post their positions and say how much is their salary, so that people for example can see how much does a Lvl 10 JS dev gains. The project can be expanded by adding courses like Udemy,  competitions and exercises like Leetcode, becoming a social media platform for developers, and so much more.

# User Stories

Certainly! User stories are a fundamental part of the Scrum framework, helping to outline the features and functionalities from a user's perspective. Here are some user stories for the development of the core application of Skillmatch, along with corresponding small issues that could be tackled in a Scrum development process:

Each issue can be estimated for complexity, assigned to team members, and tracked through the Scrum development process. As the development progresses, the team can continuously iterate, refine, and adjust the features based on user feedback and changing requirements.

# Review

Skillmatch sounds like an interesting concept that aims to address the challenges faced by job seekers in the software engineering field. The idea of creating a centralized platform that showcases a developer's portfolio, skills, courses, and background, and then using gamification to incentivize skill development, has potential. Here's a breakdown of various aspects of your project:

**Strengths:**

1. **Problem Solving:** You're addressing a real pain point in the job search process for software engineers. The need to maintain a presence on various platforms can be overwhelming, and having a centralized platform could streamline the process.

2. **Gamification:** The use of gamification can be motivating for users. By rewarding users with XP points for their skills and achievements, you're tapping into psychological aspects that encourage engagement and learning.

3. **Centralized Information:** Creating a single platform for employers and job seekers to connect based on skills and requirements can simplify the hiring process for both parties.

4. **Expansion Opportunities:** Your vision of expanding the platform to include courses, competitions, and becoming a social media platform for developers indicates a potential for growth and diversification.

**Areas to Consider:**

1. **Data Integrity:** Corroborating data manually or with machine learning is crucial to maintain the credibility of the platform. Ensuring accurate information is essential, as misinformation could hurt both job seekers and employers.

2. **Privacy and Security:** Given that personal information and professional data will be shared, security and privacy measures are paramount to protect user data.

3. **User Experience:** The platform's usability and interface will significantly impact user engagement. Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface will be important to attract and retain users.
